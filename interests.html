                <p>For almost thirty years of my life I played some form of baseball. Everything from wiffle ball, high level travel ball to slow pitch softball.
                    Now that my playing time is coming to an end, I am fortunate my son has picked up the game. I love teaching the kids everything I know about the 
                    wonderful game of baseball.</p>

                <p>One of our favorite things to do as a family is to go hiking. Exploring through the woods is one of the most fun ways to exercise.</p>
